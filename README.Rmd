# bdsy2025

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bdsy2025 is to provide a fast and simple way to load all necessary packages at once for the 2025 causal inference cohort at Yale University. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of bdsy2025 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gabriellekraft/bdsy2025")
```

## Usage

Given a specified cohort, the load_bdsy() function loads all packages associated with the cohort. It can optionally install any associated packages that are not already available in a user's R environment. 

```{r example}
library(bdsy2025)
load_bdsy("ci", install_missing = TRUE)
```
